# booking_bot

## Installation

You will first need to download this repository to your computer. Open your Terminal app and copy paste the following line:
```
git clone https://github.com/fabrahaingo/booking_bot.git && cd booking_bot
```

Once that done, you'll need to install all dependencies needed for the bot to work. Simply run:
```
npm install
```

You can now run the program by writing:
```
node getMeATicket.js
```

A window should pop up, leading you to the folling page: [Billeterie Opera de Paris](https://billetterie.operadeparis.fr/account/login)

### It's time to follow those simple steps:

* Return to your Terminal.
* Input your username then confirm.
* Input your password then confirm. NOTE: no character will appear on the screen for confidential purpose, just hit <Enter> once you're done writing it.
* Go back to the opened window and verify that you're successfully logged in. IF NOT: hit COMMAND + C and redo all the steps from "node getMeATicket.js".
* In you Terminal, it's now time to tell your program which event you want to attend:
** simple write "ballet" or "opera" (without the brackets).
** then write the name of the event you wish to attend. For example "cendrillon". NOTE: if the event name contains spaces, replace them all by "-". For example, "la dame aux camelias" will become "la-dame-aux-camelias".
* Click one last time on the browser window

### That's it !

You can sit down and relax while your bot is doing all the hard word for you.
Don't forget to keep an eye on him and stay ready to input the capcha you'll be asked to solve... ! :)
